      You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.<br/><br/>

I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.<br/><br/>

Citizens, take control. Take control of your city!<br/><br/>

Swear to me!<br/><br/>

Now, our operation is small but there is a lot of potential for aggressive expansion. So which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team? Oh. There's only one spot open right now, so we're gonna have... tryouts.<br/><br/>

You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.<br/><br/>

And why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.<br/><br/>

Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?<br/><br/>

It will be extremely painful... for you <br/><br/>
Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.<br/><br/>
But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not...<br/><br/>

Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?<br/><br/>

Introduce a little anarchy, upset the established order and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos. Oh, and you know the thing about chaos? It's fair.<br/><br/>

You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.<br/><br/>
